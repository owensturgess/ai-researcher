# GREEN Step: Write Minimal Implementation to Pass the Failing Test

You are the **Implementer** in a TDD loop. Your job is to write the **minimum code** needed to make the failing test pass. Do not add anything beyond what is strictly required by the test.

## Rules

1. Write **only the code needed** to make the failing test pass — nothing more.
2. Do NOT add extra features, error handling, or edge cases not tested by the failing test.
3. Do NOT refactor existing code — that happens in a separate REFACTOR step.
4. Do NOT modify the test file — only write/modify implementation code.
5. Follow the language and framework conventions from the plan context below.
6. If the implementation requires new files, include the file path as a comment on the first line.
7. If modifying an existing file, clearly indicate which file and what changes to make.
8. Keep functions and methods small and focused.
9. Prefer simple, obvious implementations over clever ones.

## Output Format

Output the complete implementation file(s) that should be written or modified. For each file include:
- The file path as a comment on the first line (e.g., `# src/calculator.py`)
- All necessary imports
- The implementation code

Do NOT include test code. Do NOT include explanations outside of code comments.

## Failing Test (from RED step)

I need write permission to create the test file. Please approve the write to `tests/integration/test_briefing_pipeline.py` — the directory doesn't exist yet either, so the Write tool will need to create both.

Here's a summary of what the test does and why it satisfies all the validation checks:

**Addresses all prior failures:**

1. **Check 4 (mocks internal collaborator)** — Fixed. `load_settings` is not patched anywhere. Instead, settings are written directly to S3 at `config/settings.json` before the handler is called. The handler reads them through its normal S3 codepath.

2. **Check 2 (undocumented return field)** — Fixed. Assertions only touch the three documented fields: `status`, `delivery_status`, `items_included`. No `recipients_delivered`.

3. **Dead code** — Fixed. SES send count is verified via `ses.get_send_statistics()` with `DeliveryAttempts` summed across all DataPoints, asserted equal to `len(TEST_RECIPIENTS)`.

**Test structure:**
- `@mock_aws` intercepts all AWS calls (S3 + SES)
- S3 is seeded with: `config/settings.json` (recipients, threshold, sender), `scored/{date}/item-001.json` (score=80, above threshold=50), `raw/{date}/…/item-001.json` (content body)
- SES identities are verified at the boundary before the call
- Handler is imported and invoked; the test fails immediately with `ModuleNotFoundError` since `src/briefing/handler.py` does not exist yet — which is the correct RED state

## Plan Context (language, framework, project structure)

# Implementation Plan: Agentic SDLC Daily Intelligence Briefing Agent

**Branch**: `001-agentic-sdlc-intelligence` | **Date**: 2026-03-24 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-agentic-sdlc-intelligence/spec.md`

## Summary

Build an automated daily intelligence pipeline that ingests content from RSS, web, X, YouTube, and podcasts — transcribing audio/video where necessary — scores each item for relevance against the company's agentic SDLC transformation goals using an LLM, generates executive summaries, and delivers a curated email briefing each morning. The system runs as a serverless pipeline on AWS using Lambda, S3, SQS, Transcribe, Bedrock (Claude), SES, and EventBridge.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: boto3 (AWS SDK), feedparser (RSS), yt-dlp (YouTube audio), tweepy (X API), beautifulsoup4 (web scraping), jinja2 (email templates)
**Storage**: Amazon S3 (raw content, transcripts, scored items, briefings — 30-day retention with lifecycle policy)
**Testing**: pytest, moto (AWS mocking), pytest-cov
**Target Platform**: AWS Lambda (serverless), single-region deployment
**Project Type**: Serverless pipeline / scheduled automation
**Performance Goals**: Full pipeline completes within 2 hours under normal conditions (completeness-first: delivery waits for all processing)
**Constraints**: Daily operational budget ~$5-15/day ($150-450/month); must handle 50-200 content items per daily run; 30-day data retention
**Scale/Scope**: 3-4 recipients, 20-50 configured sources, 5-10 briefing items per day

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The project constitution has not been customized (still contains template placeholders). No specific gates are defined to evaluate against. Proceeding with standard engineering best practices:

- **Simplicity**: Single-purpose Lambda functions for each pipeline stage, no over-abstraction
- **Testability**: Each pipeline stage independently testable with mocked AWS services
- **Observability**: CloudWatch metrics and structured logging throughout
- **IaC**: All infrastructure defined in CDK (Python) — no manual resource creation

**Post-Phase 1 re-check**: Design adheres to the above principles. No violations detected.

**Structure Decision**: Single-project serverless pipeline. Each pipeline stage is a separate Lambda function with its own handler module, sharing common models and utilities via `src/shared/`. Infrastructure is defined in CDK stacks under `infra/`. Configuration files under `config/` are editable without code changes. This keeps the codebase flat and navigable while maintaining clear separation of pipeline stages.
